### Valid Reasons for This Approach

1. **Clarity and Readability**:
   - Closing the code block properly before adding text helps keep your `README.md` file organized. It makes it clear which sections are code and which are explanations or instructions.

2. **Markdown Syntax**:
   - Markdown uses triple backticks to define code blocks. By closing the code block with these backticks, you ensure that Markdown renders the content correctly and does not mix code with regular text.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Well-structured documentation improves the user experience. It helps users follow instructions without confusion and easily locate the information they need.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation between code and text makes the `README.md` easier to update and maintain. When you or others revisit the file, the structure will be intuitive.

By following this method, you can ensure that your `README.md` file is well-organized, easy to read, and correctly formatted.
